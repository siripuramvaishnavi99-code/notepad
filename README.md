# 📝 Online Notes App (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

A simple and interactive **web-based Online Notes Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app allows users to create, manage, and download notes directly in the browser, with support for multiple note files.

Notes are stored using **browser localStorage**, so data remains saved even after refreshing the page.
